# About NUTRA

**NUTRA** (Neural Unseen Terrestrial Reconnaissance Architecture) is an open innovation initiative led by independent developer **Alexander Shakhov**, based in Phuket, Thailand.

This project is focused on the creation of a decentralized, low-cost, passive sensor network for global environmental and tactical monitoring. Designed to operate autonomously in any environment, the NUTRA system enables real-time detection of chemical, seismic, and thermal anomalies across oceans and land without requiring permanent infrastructure.

Key aspects of the NUTRA initiative:
- **Open and non-governmental**: NUTRA is not affiliated with any government or corporation.
- **Strategic utility**: Applications range from disaster early warning systems to submarine tracking and ecological diagnostics.
- **Scalable and affordable**: Designed to be mass-producible with household-grade components or industrial-grade sensors.
- **Ethical vision**: While the system has dual-use potential, the initiative prioritizes peaceful applications and transparency.

This project represents a prototype-ready, field-deployable technology, developed entirely outside of institutional frameworks, using personal resources and public knowledge.
