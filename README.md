# NUTRA OceanSensor

Passive, autonomous underwater sentinel for early threat detection.

## 🌊 Overview
NUTRA OceanSensor is a modular, passive underwater detection system that identifies environmental anomalies (fuel, chemical, seismic) and autonomously launches a buoy with a transmitter. It is scalable, biodegradable, stealthy, and requires no infrastructure.

## 📌 Key Features
- Passive & undetectable until triggered
- AI-based trigger logic
- Deployable from drones, boats, or manually
- Uses biodegradable or inert components
- ~$35–50 per unit; scalable to thousands

## ⚙️ System Components
- Seabed sensor (e.g., sponge or membrane)
- Trigger logic with AI microcontroller
- Autonomous buoy launcher
- GPS or radio beacon transmitter

## 🔬 Use Cases
- Oil spill detection
- Underwater sabotage alerts
- Marine reserve monitoring
- Early earthquake detection

## 🚀 TRL Status
- Currently at TRL 3–4
- Prototype ready in 10 days
- Field tests planned in Month 1–2
- TRL 6 targeted by Month 4
