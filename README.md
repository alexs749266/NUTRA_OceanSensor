# NUTRA Ocean Passive Sensor Network

This project outlines a passive underwater sensor system that detects specific environmental changes (e.g., presence of fuel or chemicals) and deploys a buoy with a transmitter to alert monitoring systems.

The system includes:
- A passive seabed sensor (e.g., membrane or sponge) that detects pollutants.
- A low-tech buoy launcher.
- Surface buoy with basic signal transmitter (GPS ping, etc.).

Purpose:
To create a low-cost, scalable ocean surveillance network that is deployable without infrastructure and suitable for long-term unattended operation.
