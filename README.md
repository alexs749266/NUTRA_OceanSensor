# NUTRA Ocean Passive Sensor Network

This project outlines a passive underwater sensor system that detects specific environmental changes (e.g., presence of fuel, chemicals, or thermal shifts) and deploys a buoy with a transmitter to alert monitoring systems.

## System Components

- **Passive seabed sensor** (e.g., membrane or sponge) that detects pollutants or disturbances
- **Low-tech buoy launcher** activated upon trigger
- **Surface buoy** with basic signal transmitter (e.g., GPS ping or simple radio)

## Key Features

- **Infrastructure-free deployment** â€” can be dropped from drones, boats, or even manually
- **Scalable** â€” thousands of units can cover critical oceanic regions
- **Untraceable** â€” passive design makes it stealthy and resilient
- **Autonomous operation** â€” no ongoing monitoring required
- **Environmental compatibility** â€” uses biodegradable or inert materials
- **Dual-use** â€” can detect both tactical threats and early signs of ecological disasters

## Autonomous AI Trigger Module

To enhance reliability and minimize false positives, the system can include an **embedded low-power AI module**. This microcontroller analyzes real-time sensor data (chemical, thermal, seismic) and autonomously determines whether to trigger the buoy release based on predefined thresholds (e.g., seismic shock > 4.0 magnitude, chemical concentration above toxic limits).

This approach enables:
- **Energy-efficient autonomous operation**
- **Customizable reaction profiles**
- **Local event classification before transmission**
