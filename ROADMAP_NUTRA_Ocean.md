## NUTRA Ocean Sensor Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the practical development path for the NUTRA Ocean Passive Sensor System. Due to the simplicity of the hardware and the well-defined functional design, progress across TRL stages is rapid and dependent primarily on deployment access.

### Development Phases

**Phase 1 – Design Finalization (Completed)**  
- Defined passive sensor concept and components  
- Autonomous AI-trigger module designed  
- Deployment method determined (drone, boat, manual)

**Phase 2 – Prototype Assembly (10 Days)**  
- Assemble full system using available parts  
- Waterproof casing and passive membrane sensor  
- AI microcontroller integration and buoy release logic  

**Phase 3 – Field Testing (Month 1–2)**  
- Static testing in controlled coastal zone  
- Evaluate sensor reactivity and AI decisions  
- Fine-tune thresholds and false positive filters  

**Phase 4 – Batch Production Readiness (Month 3)**  
- Optimize materials and build reproducibility  
- Design minimal launcher footprint  
- Ensure autonomous repeatability of trigger mechanism  

**Phase 5 – Extended Network Test (Month 4+)**  
- Deploy 10–100 units in real environments  
- Collect operational data over time  
- Integrate alert system with visualization dashboard

### TRL Positioning

| TRL | Description                             | Status                  |
|-----|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1   | Basic principles observed                | ✔ Completed             |
| 2   | Technology concept formulated            | ✔ Completed             |
| 3   | Experimental proof of concept            | ✔ Designed and feasible |
| 4   | Lab prototype validated                  | 🔜 In 10 days (Phase 2) |
| 5   | Field prototype tested                   | 🔜 Month 1–2            |
| 6   | System demonstrated in relevant env.     | 🔜 Month 3–4            |
| 7+  | Higher levels (integration/production)   | Planned                 |

> Note: Due to modular and low-power nature, TRL stages progress quickly when external field access is granted. Assembly-to-deployment window is < 14 days with existing logistics.

### Preliminary Budget (1 unit)

| Item                      | Estimated Cost (USD)   |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Electronics (MCU + sensors)| $15–25                 |
| Buoy materials            | $5–10                  |
| Power (Battery/Solar)     | $5–7                   |
| Assembly & waterproofing  | $10                    |
| **Total**                 | **~$35–50 per unit**   |

> Mass production expected to reduce cost below $25/unit.
